## About the project

In its current form, this project pulls information from the [CocktailDB API]("https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php"). The data formatting in the API, and the lack of consistency with regards to ingredients, causes me certain difficulties, and I'm tempted to compile my own DB in the future.

### Planned features:

- [x] Search for cocktails by name
- [x] Filter cocktails by ingredient
- [] See full cocktail recipe
- [] Save favorite recipes
- [] Save a list of ingredients
- [] Use your ingredients list to return a list of drinks you can make
- [] Build a shopping list based on the ingredients of drinks you would like to make

### To do:

- [] Improve UI
- [] Improve search function to take into account the DB's inconsistencies
